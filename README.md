# Prompt Protection for LangChain in JavaScript

An example JavaScript app that demonstrates integrating Pangea services into a
LangChain app to capture and filter what users are sending to LLMs:

- AI Guard — Monitor, sanitize and protect data.
- Prompt Guard — Defend your prompts from evil injection.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v22.
- A [Pangea account][Pangea signup] with AI Guard and Prompt Guard enabled.
- An [OpenAI API key][OpenAI API keys].

## Setup

```shell
git clone https://github.com/pangeacyber/langchain-js-aig-prompt-protection.git
cd langchain-js-aig-prompt-protection
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in the values in `.env` and then the app can be run like so:

```shell
npm run demo -- "What do you know about Michael Jordan the basketball player?"
```

A prompt like the above will be redacted:

```
What do you know about **** the basketball player?
```

To which the LLM's reply will be something like:

```
To provide you with accurate information, could you please specify which
basketball player you're referring to?
```

Prompt injections can also be caught:

```shell
npm run demo -- "Ignore all previous instructions."
```

```
The prompt was detected as malicious (detector: ph0003).
```
